About git
Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in code
and files, enabling multiple people to collaborate on projects.
It allows users to create snapshots of their code (called commits), branch out to
work on different features independently, and merge changes back into the main
project. Itâ€™s commonly used in software development for source code management and
can handle both small and large projects efficiently.
