TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

Annotations.

Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc…​).

Test that your code is multithread safe.

Flexible test configuration.

Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).

Support for parameters.

Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).

Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc…​).

Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.

Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).

Dependent methods for application server testing.

TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc…​

I started TestNG out of frustration for some JUnit deficiencies which I have documented on my weblog here and here Reading these entries might give you a better idea of the goal I am trying to achieve with TestNG. You can also check out a quick overview of the main features and an article describing a very concrete example where the combined use of several TestNG’s features provides for a very intuitive and maintainable testing design.
